# Stock Value Analysis

### Problem Statement:
The Stock Value Analysis project aims to analyze the stock value of a dataset obtained from the Northwind OData feed, which contains orders and products data. By utilizing Power BI, a dashboard was created to visualize the stock value from 1996 to 1998. The objective is to gain insights into the stock value trends over the years and identify regions and countries with the highest stock value.

### Questions to be Addressed:
- What is the total stock value from 1996 to 1998, and how does it vary across each year?
- Which regions of the world exhibit higher stock values, and how are they represented on the map visualization?
- How does the stock value fluctuate by year, as shown in the line chart, and which year has the highest stock value?
- What are the stock value trends by month, and which months have the highest stock value overall?
- Which countries have the highest stock value throughout the three-year analysis, as depicted in the bar graph?

- The total stock value for the analyzed period is approximately 1 million, with 226k in 1996, 658k in 1997, and 470k in 1998.

- The bar graph displaying stock value by country highlights the United States, Germany, and Austria as countries with the highest stock value throughout the three-year analysis.

### Final Conclusion:
The Stock Value Analysis project utilizing the Northwind OData feed and Power BI provides valuable insights into stock value trends and regional variations. The analysis reveals that the stock value increased steadily from 1996 to 1997, peaking in 1997. Additionally, the first four months of the year, particularly April, witnessed the highest stock value.
